# C#
1. [C# Fundamentals for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QUgvfuKvWU&list=PLb4udlTNRMm5tdPc44p7gtftuyMlC9lNT) 
        - Good intro to C# and programming basics

2. [C# Pluralsight Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/csharp) - Older C# path that I did.  Complete through LINQ, at least.
    - [Newer C# Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/c-10)<br><br>

# ASP.NET
1. [ASP.NET Razor Pages](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-6-razor-pages-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
2. [ASP.NET MVC](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-6-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
3. [ASP.NET APIs](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-6-web-api-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
    - [Continuation of API course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-6-web-api-deep-dive/table-of-contents)
        - This is a bit more advanced than the first course, so potentially return to this after doing the ASP path.
4. [ASP.NET CORE Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/aspnet-core) - Older path that I did.
    - [Newer ASP.NET Path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/aspnet-core-6)
5. [Consuming APIs](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/using-httpclient-consume-apis-dot-net/table-of-contents)<br><br>
