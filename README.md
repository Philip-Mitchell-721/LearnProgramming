# LearnProgramming
Here are some free beginner-friendly resources.  There is so much out there, but this is just a taste.  If you want more or have any other questions, please ask me.

# CS50
[Harvards CS50 Course 2024](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) <br>
        - This is a great introduction to computer science and general programming concepts.  It has a high production value and is fun to watch.<br>
        - There is a video and related material for each week.  To get the most out of this, watch the video, then watch any sections/shorts available, then complete the problem set for the week.<br>

# Dave Gray
[Full Course Programming Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6M1Uopt6_VL3gf3cpMnwavm) <br>
        - Dave Gray is a fantastic teacher.  This playlist is generally in the order you should learn things.  One potential exception currently is that Python could be learned at any point.<br>
        - Many of the videos teach you languages and topics related to Front-End programming.  I think this can be a good place to start because it is the quickest way to begin seeing your progress visually in the browser.<br>

# The Odin Project
[The Odin Project (TOP)](https://www.theodinproject.com/) <br>
        - TOP will cover many of the same topics as the Dave Gray videos.  However, in addition to videos, they will use articles and interactive code examples as the primary drivers for learning.  They will assign lots of reading, which is great for getting into the habit of reading official documentation.  This will be something you spend a lot of time doing once working in the field.<br>
        - I tend to learn faster through videos, however, I've completed a good portion of TOP, and I found that it was more thorough and filled in gaps in my knowledge.<br>
        - Part way through TOP it will have you choose a path.  I would recommend the JavaScript path.<br>

# C#
[C# Fundamentals for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QUgvfuKvWU&list=PLb4udlTNRMm5tdPc44p7gtftuyMlC9lNT) <br>
        - Good intro to C# and programming basics.  This video (well, an earlier version of it) was my very first introduction to anything programming, so it holds a special place in my heart.<br>
        - C# is the primary language I use for my job.  It's a great language, but it's fully dependent on what jobs are available to you in the end.  I think that JavaScript and Python are a bit more widely used, so they might be better to start with.  Once you know JavaScript and/or Python, learning C# or any other language will be relatively easy.  They are all very similar in concept; they just use different syntax to achieve/implement those concepts.<br>
